READEME

Project:

Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

What about it:

This is a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and Flask, 
a popular framework for Python web development. 
It stores information for four projects and displays it accordingly.

The index page displays the projects.
After a user adds a project, the information goes to the database and is displayed on the index page.
By clicking on each project, the user can redirect to its GitHub page, edit the project, or delete it.

The add project page allows users to add new projects.
If a user attempts to add a project with a title that already exists in the database,
the page displays a reminder message and prompts the user to input new information.

When editing a project, if the user changes the project title to match that of another project in the database,
the page displays a reminder message and prompts the user to input new information.

The About, Skills, and Contact pages render different sections of the about_me page to display relevant information.

During the process, I have learnt:

how to connect database, store the data and display the information;
how to use the static directory and how to use the repeat use layout contents;
how to redirect to each different page and render the corresponding templates;
how the different CSS styling to different HTML pages.
